# Portfolio with 3D Character

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where I showcase my work, skills, and experience, with a creative twist using 3D elements.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React** – Core framework for building the UI and routing
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS for clean, responsive design
- **GSAP** – Light use for subtle animations and transitions
- **Three.js** – For rendering 3D visuals in the browser
- **React Three Fiber** – React-friendly abstraction over Three.js for building 3D scenes declaratively
- **ReadyPlayerMe** – 3D character in the hero section was created using [ReadyPlayerMe](https://readyplayer.me/) — a stylized digital version of me :)
- **EmailJS** – Contact form integration for direct messaging from the website
- **GitHub Pages** – Deployed using `gh-pages`, with base path configured in `vite.config.js`

## 📦 3D Assets

- All 3D models use the **glTF (GL Transmission Format)** standard
- Some assets sourced from **Sketchfab**
- Models converted to React components using GLTF → React Three Fiber tools for smooth integration

## 🎨 About

This is a portfolio website with a creative edge. The 3D character in the hero section adds a bit of interactivity and fun - you can rotate the model as part of the design.
